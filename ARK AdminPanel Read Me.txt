ARK Admin Panel V2: By http://devzone.co.in
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARK Admin Panel, is not a full fledge Framework in real sense. It is built  
with a moto that it will help developers to kick start their projects without
wresting time in building admin panels from scratch. Hope we will succeed in this.

We do not guarantee that it is 100% bug free, though we tried to make it as stable as
we can.

INSTALLATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Unzip the package

2) Dump the sql(ark_adminPanel_v2.sql) provided as a part of this package, in mysql server.

3) Put the directory on your localhost.

4) Access it in your Admin panel.

ENJOY...
